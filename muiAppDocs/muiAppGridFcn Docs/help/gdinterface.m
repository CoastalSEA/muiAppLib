%% GDinterface
% Abstract class with properties and methods to manipulate gridded datasets 
% for use in applications that import data, or save model ouput. The class 
% inherits <matlab:doc('muidataset') muiDataSet> and together they provide 
% an extensive set of methods to handle datasets of various types (e.g. 
% from models or imported files).

%% Description
% *GDinterface* is used as a superclass to provide data handling 
% functionality for classes that import different types of data or models
% that are gridded, in order to store them in a consistent and documented format.
% The data are stored in a set of <matlab:doc('dstable') dstables>, which
% are assigned as a <matlab:doc('struct') struct> to the <matlab:doc('muicatalogue') muiCatalogue>
% _Data_ property (typically as part of a UI based on the <matlab:doc('muitoolbox') muitoolbox>). 
% The core table is the _'Grid'_ <matlab:doc('dstable') dstable> which holds the
% gridded data and supporting metadata. The metatdata for the dstable content are
% defined in the _*setDSproperties*_ method in *GDinterface*. 

%% 
% <html>
% <table border=1><tr><td><u>Note</u>: In UI's based on <a href="matlab:doc('muitoolbox')">muitoolbox</a>
% the <i>DSproperties</i> can be viewed by using the mouse button callback 
% in the first column of a Case on the Cases/Data/Model tab in the main interface.

%% GDinterface properties
% The class uses the properties defined for <matlab:doc('muidataset') muiDataSet> 

%% GDinterface methods
% The methods in the abstract class include the following:
%%
% Methods to add, delete and update grids:

%%
% *setGrid* - load the grid results into a dstable, where _obj_ is any 
% GDintereface subclass; _gridddata_ is a cell array with a matrix of
% elevations, and any other data to be included in the dstable; _dims_ is a
% struct for the dimensions of griddata, where the fields 'x' and 'y' are the 
% vector dimensions of z and must be unique, and the field 't' can be 
% datetimes, durations or values to assign to rows in dstable, and 'cline'
% is a struct with the x and y coordinates of the centre-line; and 
% _meta_ is a stuct with 'source' and 'data' fields to describe file name or model
% used, and additional run details, respectively.
%%
%   obj = setGrid(obj,griddata,dims,meta);

%%
% *getGrid* - retrieve a grid, where _obj_ is any GDintereface subclass;
% and _irow_ is the row index of the dstable to extract grid from
% (optional). Returns grid as a struct with the fields, 'x', 'y', 'z' and
% 't, together with any metadata that may be assigned to the dstable,
% including, 'irow', the row indexin the dstable, 'desc', the dstable Description, 
% and 'cline', a struct with the x and y coordinates of the centre-line.
%%
%   grid = getGrid(obj,irow);

%%
% *addGrid* - add a grid to an existing <matlab:doc('muitoolbox') muitoolbox> 
% Case table, where _obj_ is any GDintereface subclass; _muicat_ is a 
% handle to the <matlab:doc('muicatalogue') muiCatalogue>; _newgrid_ is the
% grid to add to the dstable and should be of the same dimensions as
% existing grids in the table; _timestep_ is the value to use for RowName
% in the dstable; _sourcetxt_ is the file name, or model name, to identify 
% data source; and _ismsg_ is a flag set to true to use the defualt message, 
% and false to suppress the message.

% and _orient_ is a vector of flags indicating whether the grid has been 
% flipped or rotated in the order applied (0 = no change, 1 = flip lr, 2 = flip ud,
