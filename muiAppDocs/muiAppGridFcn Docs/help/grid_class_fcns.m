%% Grid classes and functions
% The _muiAppGridFcns_ folder contains classes and functions to support the 
% handling of gridded data, for Apps built using the 
% <matlab:doc('muitoolbox') muitoolbox>.

%% Grid classes
% The Apps that use grids can make use of the following classes:
%%
% *GD_GridProps*: class inherits <matlab:doc('muipropertyui') muiPropertyUI> 
% abstract class, providing an interface to define the extent and intervals
% of a cartesian grid. Methods within the class include:
%%
% * setInput - calls the default interface to input property values for grid
% extend and grid intervals in the x and y directions.
% * setGridDimensions - pass the x and y dimensions of a grid to updatge the
% property settings.
% * getGridDimensions - retrieve the x and y dimensions as vectors and the
% grid intervals (delx, dely).

%%
% *GDinterface*: an abstract class to support classes that need additional
% functionality to handle grids. The class inherits <matlab:doc('muidataset') muiDataSet> 
% and together they provide an extensive set of methods to handle datasets
% of various types (eg from models or imported files). The methods in the
% <matlab:doc('gdinterface') GDinterface> include the following:
%%
% Methods to add, delete and update grids and propetry tables:
%%
% * setGrid - load the grid results into a dstable. 
% * getGrid - retrieve a grid.  
% * addGrid - add a grid to an existing <matlab:doc('muitoolbox') muitoolbox> Case table.
% * deleteGrid - delete a grid to an existing <matlab:doc('muitoolbox') muitoolbox> Case table.

%%
% Methods to manipulate grids:
%%
% * translateGrid - interactively translate grid x-y coordinates.
% * rotateGrid - interactively flip or rotate grid.
% * reGridData - regrid a gridded dataset to match another grid or to user
% specified dimensions.
% * subGridData - interactively define a subgrid and save grid as a new Case.
% * addSurface - add horizontal surface to an extisting grid. 
% * curvilinear_xy2sn - map grid from cartesian to curvilinear coordinates.
% * curvilinear_sn2xy - map grid from curvilinear to cartesian coordinates.
% * exportGrid - select a Case and export grid as xyz tuples.

%%
% Static methods to manipulate grids
%%
% * setCombinedGrids - superimpose one grid on another based on maximum
% or minimum set of values.
% * diffGridsPlot - generate a plot of the difference between two grids.
% * getGridLine - interactively digitise a line and save to a file.
% * gridMenuOptions - handles the menu calls ffor the default menu of Grid
% Tools. 

%%
% *GD_ImportData* class inherits GDinterface abstract class (see above)
% to load xyz data from a file. Methods within the class include:
%%
% * loadData - set up a new dataset by loading data from a file. 
% * addData - add additional data to an existing dataset.
% * tabPlots - plots the grid as a filled contour plot (can be overloaded if
% required for a specific application).

%%
% These methods are supplemented by the methods available in
% <matlab:doc('muidataset') muiDataSet> as well as the
% <matlab:doc('gdinterface') GDinterface> summarised above.

%%
% *FGDinterface*: an abstract class to support classes that need additional
% functionality to handle grids. The class inherits *GDinterface*, to extend 
% the grid handling methods, to extract inlet/channel properties
% from the grid. The setGrid, getGrid, addGrid and deleteGrid methods in
% *GDinterface* are overloaded to handle inlet/channel specific properties
% such as distance to mouth of inlet, orientation of channel, etc.
% Other methods in the <matlab:doc('fgdinterface') FGDinterface> include the following:
%%

% * addProperties - add properties to an existing set of grid property tables
% * delProperties - delete a row of properties from existing grid property
% tables
% * addFormProps - add form properties to a gridded data set

% to mouth and definition of centre-line (if used).

%%
% Static methods to manipulate grids
%%
% * addValleyBase - use an xyz definition of the channel thalweg to create 
% a valley base this is used to modify an existing valley defined above MHW 
% to include the valley form down to the pre-Holocene surface (i.e. below the
% existing channel bed).
% * addShore - add a strip to shore side of a grid by extrapolating from the
% neighbouring strip.
% * formMenuOptions - handles the menu calls ffor the default menu of Form
% Tools.

% * loadData - set up a new dataset by loading data from a file. 
% * addData - add additional data to an existing dataset.
% * tabPlots - plots the grid as a filled contour plot (can be overloaded if
% required for a specific application).

%%
% These methods are supplemented by the methods available in
% <matlab:doc('muidataset') muiDataSet> as well as the <matlab:doc('fgdinterface') FGDinterface> 
% and <matlab:doc('gdinterface') GDinterface> summarised above.
