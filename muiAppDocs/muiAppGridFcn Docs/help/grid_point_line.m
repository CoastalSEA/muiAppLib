%% Points, Lines, Sections and Segments
% A short summary of the conventions used and the functions available, to
% manipulate points, lines, sections and segments in Grid Tools.

%% Conventions
% A grid held in any class that inherits <matlab:doc('gdinterface') GDinterface> 
% and obtained from the dstable or using _getGrid_ will return an xyz
% struct where x and y are column vectors and z is a matrix. The 
% <matlab:doc('grid_class_fcns') Grid Tools> function _gd_plotgrid_ can 
% be used to plot the grid. The *GD_Sections* class and associated functions
% make use of the following conventions:
%%
% * *Points*: a single pair of x,y coordinates or a set of points. Use
% _gd_pnt2vec_ and gd_vec2pnt to convert between points and other formats.
%%
% <html>
% <ul><ul>
% <li><i>point</i> - a struct with fields x, y (and z) containing the coordinates of a point.</li>
% <li><i>points</i> - a row struct array of xy(z) <i>point</i> structs .</li>
% </ul></ul>
% </html>

%%
% * *Lines*: a single line with 2 or more points, or a set of lines.
%%
% <html>
% <ul><ul>
% <li><i>line</i> - x, y (and z) column vectors terminated with a Nan. 
% Can be a matrix, struct or table.</li>
% <li><i>lines</i> - x, y (and z) column vectors with line segments defined by NaN terminators.</li>
% </ul></ul>
% </html>

%%
% * *pLines*: a set of 2 or more _points_ that define a line.
%%
% <html>
% <ul><ul>
% <li><i>pline</i> - a <i>points</i> array terminated with a NaN <i>point</i>.</li>
% <li><i>plines</i> - cell array of <i>pline</i> segments concatenated as a row struct array, 
% with individual <i>pline</i> segments defined by NaN terminators.</li>
% </ul></ul>
% </html>

%%
% * *Segments*: multiple sets of lines held in a single cell array.
%%
% <html>
% <ul><ul>
% <li><i>cplines</i> - a cell array of <i>plines</i> (each of any length and any number of lines).</li>
% </ul></ul>
% </html>

%%
% * *Sections*: a special case of a _pline_ with only 2 _points_ (start and
% end) and a NaN _point_.
%%
% <html>
% <ul><ul>
% <li><i>pslice</i> - a <i>pline</i> defined by two end <i>points</i>.</li>
% <li><i>pslices</i> - multiple <i>pslice</i> segments concatenated as a row struct array, 
% with individual <i>pslice</i> segments defined by NaN terminators.</li>
% </ul></ul>
% </html>

%%
% Hence a _line_ and _lines_ are always a set of column vectors in a struct,
% table or matrix. Whereas the other formats are all different arrays of a _point_ set.

%%
% <html>
% <table border=1><tr><td><u><b>Notes</b></u>:<br><br>
% <li>To extract a <i>point</i> from <i>points</i> use: &emsp; point = points(i);</li><br>
% <li>To extract the ith <i>pline</i> of points from a <i>plines</i>
% use:</li><br>
% &emsp; &emsp; idN = [0,find(isnan([points(:).x]))];<br>
% &emsp; &emsp;   for i=1:length(idN)-1<br>
% &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; pline{1,i} = points(idN(i)+1:idN(i+1));<br>
% &emsp; &emsp;   end<br><br>
% <li>To switch between plines and cplines use <i>gd_plines2cplines</i>and <i>gd_cplines2plines</i>;</li><br>
% <li>To switch between point, or points, and line, or lines, use
% <i>gd_points2lines</i> and <i>gd_lines2points</i>.</li><br>
% <li>When using lines, some functions use row vectors and others use
% column vectors. <br>&emsp; To switch an xy struct from column to row or vice versa use:<br>
%  &emsp; &emsp; lines = structfun(@transpose,lines,'UniformOutput',false); <br><br>

%% Classes
% The Apps that inherit <matlab:doc('gdinterface') GDinterface> can make use of 
% *GD_Sections* to manipulate points and lines, and extract boundaries and
% cente-lines from an imported digital terrain model. This extends the
% capability of the functions provided as part of the standard
% <matlab:doc('grid_menu_help') Grid tools Menu>. 

%%
% *GD_Sections*: provides methods to manipulate points, lines and sections 
% using datasets in classes that inherit <matlab:doc('gdinterface') GDinterface>.

%%
% Properties for sections:
%%
% * _Boundary_ - enclosing boundary used to crop length of sections.
% * _ChannelLine_ - centre-line of channel can be multiple lines to define
% a network.
% * _ChannelProps_ - properties used when extracting the channel network.
% * _SectionLines_ - sections defined at right angles to points on
% centre-line extending to Boundaray line (if cropping applied).
%%
% All properties are held as _lines_ and the GD_Sections instance is saved 
% to the Sections property in the calling class (e.g. EDBimport).

%%
% Methods to manipulate sections:
%% 
% * setBoundary - load a grid and interactively define a boundary line with
% options to autogenerate and edit or digistise the line.
% * setChannelNetwork - load a grid and extract the centre lines of the channels in
% a network, or digitise them manually, and combine into a vector of points.
% * setSectionLines - use the centre-line to generate a set of sections at right
% angles and interactively edit them, or digitise them manually.
% * setSections - using the SectionLines data extract the widths as
% a function of elevation and distance along the centre-line.
% * viewsections - view boundary channel network and cross-sections line work.

%%
% Static methods to manipulate sections:
%%
% * editLines - edit linework for selected line type (can be Boundary,
% Channel Network or Section Lines).
% * loadLines -  load linework for selected line type from a shapefile.
% * getSection - retrieve existing class object or create a new instance.
% * sectionMenuOptions - default set of menu options for use in Model UIs
% such as EstuaryDB. Can be used to call any of the methods listed above
